# CS361---Portfolio Project

To run this project you will need to have python 3.8 or above installed on your device.
This was written and executed with python3.8, if it does not run, try running it with python3.8

The packages used in this project should be covered by the Python standard library, the modules are:
time
os

To run, simply execute in terminal or the python shell.  Note the encrypt.py microservice code will
also have to be running if you wish to encrypt/decrypt the backup file of your list.

The menu presents the user with options for the program.  After every execution it will clear the contents of the screen
and bring you back to the menu.

Following the prompts you have the option to import or export a list, and the exported list can be encrypted.
The imported list has an option of an encrypted file or a normal backup text file.

Note, the microservice has to be running if you wish to encrypt and decrypt!

This is my first full program in Python, this was a lot of fun and made learning the concepts for Python simple and quick.

I hope you have fun tinkering with this project.  It's written to be executed in a command-line environment, but it can be adapted to work with a GUI
with some effort. I wanted to make it possible to run in a minimalist environment if someone chose to do so.
